# Matlab-Unity-Communication
This are simple script to make Matlab communicate with unity

You can find the video tutorial at this link

IMPORTANT: in the public class ***** : MonoBehaviour

Instead of the ***** write the name of the c sharp file. In my case it was Cylinder. Check in the object you created in unity which is
the name of the obejct and name the file in the same way.

The most important thing is that when you created the c sharp file in unity, you first press play in unity and then run the matlab code,
otherwise it will not work.

If you are interested only in the c sharp code that makes them communicate, you can find it in the "C_Sharp_Communication_Only" file.
